        <h2>Q.1 : local storage vs session storage?</h2>

        <span class="bold">Ans:</span>

        localStorage and sessionStorage are almost identical and have the same
        API. The difference is that with sessionStorage , the data is persisted
        only until the window or tab is closed. With localStorage , the data is
        persisted until the user manually clears the browser cache or until your
        web app clears the data.

        <h2>Q.2 : global scope and block scope?</h2>
        <span class="bold">Ans:</span>
        In a browser environment, the global scope is controlled by the window
        object while in Node. js, it's controlled by the global object. Block
        scopes are what you get when you use if statements, for statements, and
        the like.

        <h2>Q.3 : How does the Event Loop works in JavaScript?</h2>
        <span class="bold">Ans:</span>
        The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear
        before pushing callbacks from the Task Queue to the Call Stack. Once the
        Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and checks the Task Queue for
        available callbacks.

        <h2>Q.4 : how we can get undefined in javascript?</h2>
        <span class="bold">Ans:</span>
        You will get undefined value when you call a non-existent property or
        method of an object. In the above example, a function Sum does not
        return any result but still we try to assign its resulted value to a
        variable. So in this case, result will be undefined.
